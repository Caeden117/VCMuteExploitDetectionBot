# VC Mute Exploit Detection Bot
A simple bot that detects and bans users who attempt to speak while using an exploit to appear muted or deafened.

## Installation
Each bot is designed to monitor only one channel at a time. As such, it is recommended to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to easily create multiple instances.

### Usage (Docker)

#### Compose
A Docker Compose file is provided in the repo. You can use this directly, but it is recommended to build upon this file to suit your own needs. It is recommended if you need to deploy multiple bots for multiple voice channels, while also keeping effort low settings consistent.

#### Manual
1. Build the image (`caeden117/vc-exploit-monitor-bot`)
2. Start the container, be sure to link the environment file: `docker run --name VCMuteExploitDetectionBot --env-file .env caeden117/vc-exploit-monitor-bot`

### Usage (.NET CLI)
Ensure that you have the [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

1. Clone the repo
2. Restore NuGet packages: `dotnet restore VCMuteExploitDetectionBot.csproj`
3. Build the project: `dotnet publish VCMuteExploitDetectionBot.csproj -c Release`
4. Navigate to the output folder, rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill it out.
5. Run the bot: `dotnet VCMuteExploitDetectionBot.dll`

## Configuration
Configuration for this bot is done through environment variables, more specifically through the `.env` file. You *could* set them manually, but it's highly recommended to use this file.

### `.env` File
The source code comes with a `.env.example` file. Each environment variable has been commented for your convenience. Simply rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out. Any required variables have been marked as such in the example file.

## Logging
This bot automatically logs to a `Logs` subdirectory of it's installation folder. This is not picked up by Git.

If you are using Docker and built the image from the source, it should automatically clone logs to the source folder.

## Development
It is recommended to use an IDE such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

Ensure that the IDE of your choice is up-to-date, has support for .NET 5 development, and that you have the [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

1. Clone this repo. Please do any contributions on a new branch.
2. Restore NuGet packages. In most IDEs, this should be done automatically.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out. This will not be picked up by Git.
4. Use the built-in debugger of your IDE to launch and test the bot.
